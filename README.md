# code-quiz

Task:
- To create a basic timed coding quiz where beginner coders can test their knowledge in JavaScript.
- The project was to be styled in a polished and personalized way
- A timer counts down throughout the quiz, and wrong answers deduct seconds from the timer
- A final score is calculated
- The user would be able to save their initials and score to the leaderboard


What was done:
- A simple quiz was created
- Classes and IDs have been grabbed from the HTML for use in the JS, and have had variable names assigned to them
- Questions and answers are contained in an object inside an array
- A function was created to deduct seconds from the timer for each second and for each incorrect answer
- A function was created to compare the established correct answer with the submission of the user's answer to determine whether the user's answer is correct
- The questions and their answers show up in succession and are prompted when the user clicks on an answer
- A function was created which ends the game and shows form to enter initials and the leaderboard


How to use:
- Click on the start button to start the quiz
- Read the questions and choose the most likely answer
- When the quiz ends (when the time is up or the questions have all been answered), type initials into the initial form and click submit.
